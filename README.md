# Sense System

**Sense System** is an AI-powered ecosystem designed to extract signal, model alignment, and surface directional intent *before* momentum becomes visible.

This is not analytics.  
This is **pre-momentum intelligence**.

## 🧠 What is Sense System?

Sense System observes fragmented data streams, interprets weak signals, and aligns them into actionable directional intent.

It answers questions like:
- *Where is attention forming before price, traffic, or narrative moves?*
- *What signals are noise — and which ones are early gravity wells?*
- *How do independent signals converge into alignment?*

Sense System operates **upstream of momentum**.

## ✨ Core Principles

- **Signal > Data**  
  Not all data matters. Sense extracts what *moves* systems.

- **Alignment > Prediction**  
  We don’t predict outcomes — we model directional coherence.

- **Intent > Action**  
  Intent forms before behavior. Behavior forms before metrics.
